J-lunker evals your codes online, makes them convenient to share or embed them in your articals, it is very similar to embed.plnkr.co, including the UI and the usage.

## Why j-lunker
We've already got embed.plnkr.co, and why we need j-lunker? Here is the reasons:

- **GFW troubles**! This is the main reason why I create j-lunker.
- Faster network access from the mainland of China. Most of the document readers of Jigsaw come from the mainland of China now, they will be happy if the demos eval faster.
